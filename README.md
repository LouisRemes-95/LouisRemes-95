# Hey, I'm Louis 👋

PhD candidate in computational mechanics, which basically means:  
I force massive matrices into RAM and pray the convergence gods 🙏

### What I Do 🏗️
- Turn messy **CT scans** into **BEAUTIFUL** simulation-ready geometries  
- Write **Python / C++ / MATLAB / Go** to invoke converge on the first try (TLDR: they don’t)  
- Build tools to analyze and simulate complex materials and 3D prints  
- Explain FEM and mechanics to students without breaking their will to live (usually)

### Current Project ⚙️
> A Python meshing tool for interfacing implicit geometries

### Tech & Tools I Use 🛠️
- **Python**, **MATLAB**, **C++**, **Go**  
- **Abaqus**, Siemens NX, SolidWorks  
- **Blender** (for *scientific illustrations* 🎨)

### Fun Facts 🍃
- I ski, wakeboard, and kitesurf  
- I volunteer as a cook. People eat it. People survive. This is a success 😎

If you're building something cool in simulation, HPC, backend systems, or 3D data processing —  
**I want in.**
